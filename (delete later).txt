1. first, make sure that the password for the db isn't hardcoded in conn.py, make sure we follow security:
    check criteria below (canvas)
2. make our user manual and team report, delete any temp / unnecessary files. fixing up comments and any dev stuff that is not needed anymore.
3. make sure all the functionality we added work and don't crash, (lots of testing for this).
4. rest of criteria (we are pretty good here, minus the security and full testing):
    - User Manual & Final Team Report are Reasonable & Code Posted on GitHub
    - 8 tables
    - 10 Queries with Transactions, Sorting etc.
    -Functioning Front End
        Doesn't crash or throw errors etc.
    - Security Best Practices
        No SQL Injection
        No hardcoded database password in code
        Hash Passwords
